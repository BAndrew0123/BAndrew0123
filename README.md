- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer was an abacus?
-               Invented in Babylon in 500 B.C., the abacus was made of string and beads and was used to count and keep track of money and other things.
-                 It’s amazing to think that the concept of computing has been around for over 2,500 years!
